Fox doubt is a phrase from commentary on Baizhang’s Fox, a famous Zen koan. I’m drawn to this phase because of the compelling imagery it evokes. Doubt is a very important instinct in both human and animal life. It helps us discern danger and safety. The fox is quick-witted and beguiling, so what is a fox’s doubt like? Even more interestingly, on what circumstances does she cast doubt? 

I hope I approach creating things with the fox’s doubt, a kind of deliberation that looks to instinct, experience and a little ferocity before and within creative actions.
