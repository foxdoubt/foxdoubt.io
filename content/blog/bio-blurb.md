_Fox doubt_ is a phrase found in <a class="bold" rel="noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_fox_koan" target="_blank">Baizhang’s Fox</a>, a famous Zen koan. I’m drawn to this phase because of the compelling imagery it evokes. Doubt is a very important instinct in both human and animal life. It helps us discern danger and safety. The fox is quick-witted and beguiling, so what is the fox’s doubt like? Even more interestingly, in what circumstances does the fox experience doubt?

I hope I approach creating things with the fox’s doubt, a flavor of deliberation that looks to instinct, experience and a little ferocity before and within creative actions.
