=======
- get some social media icons
- write first blog
- do an accessibility audit
- buy domain and host somewhere



- include custom paths for URLs
- make react dev errors and warnings go away
- refactor global scss (modularize, use partials syntax, trim down by seeing what isn't having an effect)
- add punctuation to bio blurb markdown
- rename the props of the tablet sidebar to be more readable/understandable, generally clean up react
-- figure out how to omit content that's not blog content from ending up in the sidebar
